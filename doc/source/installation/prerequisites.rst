=============

Topshelf is a .Net framework for C# and will need a .Net runtime to run on.

To work with Topshelf you will need to be running on a Windows operating
system. The developers of Topshelf regulary test on Windows 7 and
Windows Server 2008RC2. Though it should still work on Windows Server 2003, as
long as .Net 3.5 sp1 is installed.
